solid and the Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed Quirrell around , bouncing off the back of his turban .\\n The few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by Hagrid before they could fly off again .\\n No one could wait for the holidays to start .\\n While the Gryffindor common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires , the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms .\\n Worst of all were Professor Snape’s classes down in the dungeons , where their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot cauldrons .\\n “ I do feel so sorry , ” said Draco Malfoy , one Potions class , “ for all those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they’re not wanted at home . ”\\n He was looking over at Harry as he spoke .\\n Crabbe and Goyle chuckled .\\n Harry , who was measuring out powdered spine of lion fish , ignored them .\\n Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditch match .\\n Disgusted that the Slytherins had lost , he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a wide mouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as Seeker next .\\n Then he’d realized that nobody found this funny , because they were all so impressed at the way Harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick .\\n So Malfoy , jealous and angry , had gone back to taunting Harry about having no proper family .\\n It was true that Harry wasn’t going back to Privet Drive for Christmas .\\n Professor McGonagall had come around the week before , making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays , and Harry had signed up at once .\\n He didn’t feel sorry for himself at all this would probably be the best Christmas he’d ever had .\\n Ron and his brothers were staying , too , because Mr and Mrs Weasley were going to Romania to visit Charlie .\\n When they left the dungeons at the end of Potions , they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead .\\n Two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind it .\\n “ Hi , Hagrid , want any help ? ”\\n Ron asked , sticking his head through the branches .\\n “ Nah , I’m all right , thanks , Ron . ”\\n “ Would you mind moving out of the way ? ”\\n came Malfoy’s cold drawl from behind them .\\n “ Are you trying to earn some extra money , Weasley ?\\n Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts , I suppose that hut of Hagrid’s must seem like a palace compared to what your family’s used to . ”\\n Ron dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs .\\n “ WEASLEY ! ”\\n Ron let go of the front of Malfoy’s robes .\\n “ He was provoked , Professor Snape , ” said Hagrid , sticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree .\\n “ Malfoy was insultin ’ his family . ”\\n “ Be that as it may , fighting is against Hogwarts rules , Hagrid , ” said Snape silkily .\\n “ Five points from Gryffindor , Weasley , and be grateful it isn’t more .\\n Move along , all of you . ”\\n Malfoy , Crabbe , and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree , scattering needles everywhere and smirking .\\n “ I’ll get him , ” said Ron , grinding his teeth at Malfoy’s back , “ one of these days , I’ll get him ” “ I hate them both , ” said Harry , “ Malfoy and Snape . ”\\n “ Come on , cheer up , it’s nearly Christmas , ” said Hagrid .\\n “ Tell yeh what , come with me an ’ see the Great Hall , looks a treat . ”\\n So the three of them followed Hagrid and his tree off to the Great Hall , where Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick were busy with the Christmas decorations .\\n “ Ah , Hagrid , the last tree put it in the far corner , would you ? ”\\n The hall looked spectacular .\\n Festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all around the walls , and no less than twelve towering Christmas trees stood around the room , some sparkling with tiny icicles , some glittering with hundreds of candles .\\n “ How many days you got left until yer holidays ? ”\\n Hagrid asked .\\n “ Just one , ” said Hermione .\\n “ And that reminds me Harry , Ron , we’ve got half an hour before lunch , we should be in the library . ”\\n “ Oh yeah , you’re right , ” said Ron , tearing his eyes away from Professor Flitwick , who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree .\\n “ The library ? ”\\n said Hagrid , following them out of the hall .\\n “ Just before the holidays ?\\n Bit keen , aren’t yeh ? ”\\n “ Oh , we’re not working , ” Harry told him brightly .\\n “ Ever since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we’ve been trying to find out who he is . ”\\n “ You what ? ”\\n Hagrid looked shocked .\\n “ Listen here I’ve told yeh drop it .\\n It’s nothin ’ to you what that dog’s guardin ’ . ”\\n “ We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is , that’s all , ” said Hermione .\\n “ Unless you’d like to tell us and save us the trouble ? ”\\n Harry added .\\n “ We must’ve been through hundreds of books already and we can’t find him anywhere just give us a hint I know I’ve read his name somewhere . ”\\n “ I’m sayin ’ nothin ’ , ” said Hagrid flatly .\\n “ Just have to find out for ourselves , then , ” said Ron , and they left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library .\\n They had indeed been searching books for Flamel’s name ever since Hagrid had let it slip , because how else were they going to find out what Snape was trying to steal ?\\n The trouble was , it was very hard to know where to begin , not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a book .\\n He wasn’t in Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century , or Notable Magical Names of Our Time he was missing , too , from Important Modern Magical Discoveries , and A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry .\\n And then , of course , there was the sheer size of the library tens of thousands of books thousands of shelves hundreds of narrow rows .\\n Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random .\\n Harry wandered over to the Restricted Section .\\n He had been wondering for a while if Flamel wasn’t somewhere in there .\\n Unfortunately , you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books , and he knew he’d never get one .\\n These were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts , and only read by older students studying advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts .\\n “ What are you looking for , boy ? ”\\n “ Nothing , ” said Harry .\\n Madam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him .\\n “ You’d better get out , then .\\n Go on out ! ”\\n Wishing he’d been a bit quicker at thinking up some story , Harry left the library .\\n He , Ron , and Hermione had already agreed they’d better not ask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel .\\n They were sure she’d be able to tell them , but they couldn’t risk Snape hearing what they were up to .\\n Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything , but he wasn’t very hopeful .\\n They had been looking for two weeks , after all , but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn’t surprising they’d found nothing .\\n What they really needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks .\\n Five minutes later , Ron and Hermione joined him , shaking their heads .\\n They went off to lunch .\\n “ You will keep looking while I’m away , won’t you ? ”\\n said Hermione .\\n “ And send me an owl if you find anything . ”\\n “ And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is , ” said Ron .\\n “ It’d be safe to ask them . ”\\n “ Very safe , as they’re both dentists , ” said Hermione .\\n Once the holidays had started , Ron and Harry were having too good a time to think much about Flamel .\\n They had the dormitory to themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual , so they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire .\\n They sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting fork bread , English muffins , marshmallows and plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled , which were fun to talk about even if they wouldn’t work .\\n Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess .\\n This was exactly like Muggle chess except that the figures were alive , which made it a lot like directing troops in battle .\\n Ron’s set was very old and battered .\\n Like everything else he owned , it had once belonged to someone else in his family in this case , his grandfather .\\n However , old chessmen weren’t a drawback at all .\\n Ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted .\\n Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him , and they didn’t trust him at all .\\n He wasn’t a very good player yet and they kept shouting different bits of advice at him , which was confusing .\\n “ Don’t send me there , can’t you see his knight ?\\n Send him , we can afford to lose him . ”\\n On Christmas Eve , Harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun , but not expecting any presents at all .\\n When he woke early in the morning , however , the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bed .\\n “ Merry Christmas , ” said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe .\\n “ You , too , ” said Harry .\\n “ Will you look at this ?\\n I’ve got some presents ! ”\\n “ What did you expect , turnips ? ”\\n said Ron , turning to his own pile , which was a lot bigger than Harry’s .\\n Harry picked up the top parcel .\\n It was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it was To Harry , from Hagrid .\\n Inside was a roughly cut wooden flute .\\n Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself .\\n Harry blew it it sounded a bit like an owl .\\n A second , very small parcel contained a note .\\n We received your message and enclose your Christmas present .\\n From Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia .\\n Taped to the note was a fifty pence piece .\\n “ That’s friendly , ” said Harry .\\n Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence .\\n “ Weird ” he said , “ What a shape !\\n This is money ? ”\\n “ You can keep it , ” said Harry , laughing at how pleased Ron was .\\n “ Hagrid and my aunt and uncle so who sent these ? ”\\n “ I think I know who that one’s from , ” said Ron , turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy parcel .\\n “ My mom .\\n I told her you didn’t expect any presents and oh , no , ” he groaned , “ she’s made you a Weasley sweater . ”\\n Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick , hand knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge .\\n “ Every year she makes us a sweater , ” said Ron , unwrapping his own , “ and mine’s always maroon . ”\\n “ That’s really nice of her , ” said Harry , trying the fudge , which was very tasty .\\n His next present also contained candy a large box of Chocolate Frogs from Hermione .\\n This only left one parcel .\\n Harry picked it up and felt it .\\n It was very light .\\n He unwrapped it .\\n Something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming folds .\\n Ron gasped .\\n “ I’ve heard of those , ” he said in a hushed voice , dropping the box of Every Flavor Beans he’d gotten from Hermione .\\n “ If that’s what I think it is they’re really rare , and really valuable . ”\\n “ What is it ? ”\\n Harry picked the shining , silvery cloth off the floor .\\n It was strange to the touch , like water woven into material .\\n “ It’s an Invisibility Cloak , ” said Ron , a look of awe on his face .\\n “ I’m sure it is try it on . ”\\n Harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a yell .\\n “ It is !\\n Look down ! ”\\n Harry looked down at his feet , but they were gone .\\n He dashed to the mirror .\\n Sure enough , his reflection looked back at him , just his head suspended in midair , his body completely invisible .\\n He pulled the cloak over his head and his reflection vanished completely .\\n “ There’s a note ! ”\\n said Ron suddenly .\\n “ A note fell out of it ! ”\\n Harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter .\\n Written in narrow , loopy writing he had never seen before were the following words : Your father left this in my possession before he died .\\n It is time it was returned to you .\\n Use it well .\\n A Very Merry Christmas to you .\\n There was no signature .\\n Harry stared at the note .\\n Ron was admiring the cloak .\\n “ I’d give anuthinq for one of these , ” he said .\\n “ Anuthinq .\\n What’s the matter ? ”\\n “ Nothing , ” said Harry .\\n He felt very strange .\\n Who had sent the cloak ?\\n Had it really once belonged to his father ?\\n Before he could say or think anything else , the dormitory door was flung open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in .\\n Harry stuffed the cloak quickly out of sight .\\n He didn’t feel like sharing it with anyone else yet .\\n “ Merry Christmas ! ”\\n “ Hey , look Harry’s got a Weasley sweater , too ! ”\\n Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters , one with a large yellow F on it , the other a G .\\n “ Harry’s is better than ours , though , ” said Fred , holding up Harry’s sweater .\\n “ She obviously makes more of an effort if you’re not family . ”\\n “ Why aren’t you wearing yours , Ron ? ”\\n George demanded .\\n “ Come on , get it on , they’re lovely and warm . ”\\n “ I hate maroon , ” Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head .\\n “ You haven’t got a letter on yours , ” George observed .\\n “ I suppose she thinks you don’t forget your name .\\n But we’re not stupid we know we’re called Gred and Forge . ”\\n “ What’s all this noise ? ”\\n Percy Weasley stuck his head through the door , looking disapproving .\\n He had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he , too , carried a lumpy sweater over his arm , which Fred seized .\\n “ P for prefect !\\n Get it on , Percy , come on , we’re all wearing ours , even Harry got one . ”\\n “ I don’t want ” said Percy thickly , as the twins forced the sweater over his head , knocking his glasses askew .\\n “ And you’re not sitting with the prefects today , either , ” said George .\\n “ Christmas is a time for family . ”\\n They frog marched Percy from the room , his arms pinned to his side by his sweater .\\n Harry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner .\\n A hundred fat , roast turkeys mountains of roast and boiled potatoes platters of chipolatas tureens of buttered peas , silver boats of thick , rich gravy and cranberry sauce and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table .\\n These fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought , with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside .\\n Harry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didn’t just bang , it went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke , while from the inside exploded a rear admiral’s hat and several live , white mice .\\n Up at the High Table , Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard’s hat for a flowered bonnet , and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick had just read him .\\n Flaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey .\\n Percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver Sickle embedded in his slice .\\n Harry watched Hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine , finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek , who , to Harry’s amazement , giggled and blushed , her top hat lopsided .\\n When Harry finally left the table , he was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers , including a pack of non explodable , luminous balloons , a Grow Your Own Warts kit , and his own new wizard chess set .\\n The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as Mrs Norris’s Christmas dinner .\\n Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds .\\n Then , cold , wet , and gasping for breath , they returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room , where Harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron .\\n He suspected he wouldn’t have lost so badly if Percy hadn’t tried to help him so much .\\n After a meal of turkey sandwiches , crumpets , trifle , and Christmas cake , everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor Tower because they’d stolen his prefect badge .\\n It had been Harry’s best Christmas day ever .\\n Yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day .\\n Not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it : the Invisibility Cloak and whoever had sent it .\\n Ron , full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him , fell asleep almost as soon as he’d drawn the curtains of his four poster .\\n Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it .\\n His father’s this had been his father’s .\\n He let the material flow over his hands , smoother than silk , light as air .\\n Use it well , the note had said .\\n He had to try it , now .\\n He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around himself .\\n Looking down at his legs , he saw only moonlight and shadows .\\n It was a very funny feeling .\\n Use it well .\\n Suddenly , Harry felt wide awake .\\n The whole of Hogwarts was open to him in this cloak .\\n Excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark and silence .\\n He could go anywhere in this , anywhere , and Filch would never know .\\n Ron grunted in his sleep .\\n Should Harry wake him ?\\n Something held him back his father’s cloak he felt that this time the first time he wanted to use it alone .\\n He crept out of the dormitory , down the stairs , across the common room , and climbed through the portrait hole .\\n “ Who’s there ? ”\\n squawked the Fat Lady .\\n Harry said nothing .\\n He walked quickly down the corridor .\\n Where should he go ?\\n He stopped , his heart racing , and thought .\\n And then it came to him .\\n The Restricted Section in the library .\\n He’d be able to read as long as he liked , as long as it took to find out who Flamel was .\\n He set off , drawing the Invisibility Cloak tight around him as he walked .\\n The library was pitch black and very eerie .\\n Harry lit a lamp to see his way along the rows of books .\\n The lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair , and even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it , the sight gave him the creeps .\\n The Restricted Section was right at the back of the library .\\n Stepping carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the library , he held up his lamp to read the titles .\\n They didn’t tell him much .\\n Their peeling , faded gold letters spelled words in languages Harry couldn’t understand .\\n Some had no title at all .\\n One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood .\\n The hairs on the back of Harry’s neck prickled .\\n Maybe he was imagining it , maybe not , but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books , as though they knew someone was there who shouldn’t be .\\n He had to start somewhere .\\n Setting the lamp down carefully on the floor , he looked along the bottom shelf for an interesting looking book .\\n A large black and silver volume caught his eye .\\n He pulled it out with difficulty , because it was very heavy , and , balancing it on his knee , let it fall open .\\n A piercing , bloodcurdling shriek split the silence the book was screaming !\\n Harry snapped it shut , but the shriek went on and on , one high , unbroken , earsplitting note .\\n He stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp , which went out at once .\\n Panicking , he heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf , he ran for it .\\n He passed Filch in the doorway Filch’s pale , wild eyes looked straight through him , and Harry slipped under Filch’s outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor , the book’s shrieks still ringing in his ears .\\n He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor .\\n He had been so busy getting away from the library , he hadn’t paid attention to where he was going .\\n Perhaps because it was dark , he didn’t recognize where he was at all .\\n There was a suit of armor near the kitchens , he knew , but he must be five floors above there .\\n “ You asked me to come directly to you , Professor , if anyone was wandering around at night , and somebody’s been in the library Restricted Section . ”\\n Harry felt the blood drain out of his face .\\n Wherever he was , Filch must know a shortcut , because his soft , greasy voice was getting nearer , and to his horror , it was Snape who replied , “ The Restricted Section ?\\n Well , they can’t be far , we’ll catch them . ”\\n Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner ahead .\\n They couldn’t see him , of course , but it was a narrow corridor and if they came much nearer they’d knock right into him the cloak didn’t stop him from being solid .\\n He backed away as quietly as he could .\\n A door stood ajar to his left .\\n It was his only hope .\\n He squeezed through it , holding his breath , trying not to move it , and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their noticing anything .\\n They walked straight past , and Harry leaned against the wall , breathing deeply , listening to their footsteps dying away .\\n That had been close , very close .\\n It was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in .\\n It looked like an unused classroom .\\n The dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls , and there was an upturned wastepaper basket but propped against the wall facing him was something that didn’t look as if it belonged there , something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way .\\n It was a magnificent mirror , as high as the ceiling , with an ornate gold frame , standing on two clawed feet .\\n There was an inscription carved around the top : Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi .\\n His panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape , Harry moved nearer to the mirror , wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again .\\n He stepped in front of it .\\n He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming .\\n He whirled around .\\n His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed for he had seen not only himself in the mirror , but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him .\\n But the room was empty .\\n Breathing very fast , he turned slowly back to the mirror .\\n There he was , reflected in it , white and scared looking , and there , reflected behind him , were at least ten others .\\n Harry looked over his shoulder but still , no one was there .\\n Or were they all invisible , too ?\\n Was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirrors trick was that it reflected them , invisible or not ?\\n He looked in the mirror again .\\n A woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving .\\n He reached out a hand and felt the air behind him .\\n If she was really there , he’d touch her , their reflections were so close together , but he felt only air she and the others existed only in the mirror .\\n She was a very pretty woman .\\n She had dark red hair and her eyes her eyes are just like mine , Harry thought , edging a little closer to the glass .\\n Bright green exactly the same shape , but then he noticed that she was crying smiling , but crying at the same time .\\n The tall , thin , black haired man standing next to her put his arm around her .\\n He wore glasses , and his hair was very untidy .\\n It stuck up at the back , just as Harry’s did .\\n Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection .\\n “ Mom ? ”\\n he whispered .\\n “ Dad ? ”\\n They just looked at him , smiling .\\n And slowly , Harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror , and saw other pairs of green eyes like his , other noses like his , even a little old man who looked as though he had Harry’s knobbly knees Harry was looking at his family , for the first time in his life .\\n The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at them , his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them .\\n He had a powerful kind of ache inside him , half joy , half terrible sadness .\\n How long he stood there , he didn’t know .\\n The reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses .\\n He couldn’t stay here , he had to find his way back to bed .\\n He tore his eyes away from his mother’s face , whispered , “ I’ll come back , ” and hurried from the room .\\n “ You could have woken me up , ” said Ron , crossly .\\n “ You can come tonight , I’m going back , I want to show you the mirror . ”\\n “ I’d like to see your mom and dad , ” Ron said eagerly .\\n “ And I want to see all your family , all the Weasleys , you’ll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone . ”\\n “ You can see them any old time , ” said Ron .\\n “ Just come round my house this summer .\\n Anyway , maybe it only shows dead people .\\n Shame about not finding Flamel , though .\\n Have some bacon or something , why aren’t you eating anything ? ”\\n Harry couldn’t eat .\\n He had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight .\\n He had almost forgotten about Flamel .\\n It didn’t seem very important anymore .\\n Who cared what the three headed dog was guarding ?\\n What did it matter if Snape stole it , really ?\\n “ Are you all right ? ”\\n said Ron .\\n “ You look odd . ”\\n What Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again .\\n With Ron covered in the cloak , too , they had to walk much more slowly the next night .\\n They tried retracing Harry’s route from the library , wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour .\\n “ I’m freezing , ” said Ron .\\n “ Let’s forget it and go back . ”\\n “ IVo ! ”\\n Harry hissed .\\n “ I know it’s here somewhere . ”\\n They passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction , but saw no one else .\\n Just as Ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold , Harry spotted the suit of armor .\\n “ It’s here just here yes ! ”\\n They pushed the door open .\\n Harry dropped the cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror .\\n There they were .\\n His mother and father beamed at the sight of him .\\n “ See ? ”\\n Harry whispered .\\n “ I can’t see anything . ”\\n “ Look !\\n Look at them all there are loads of them . ”\\n “ I can only see you . ”\\n “ Look in it properly , go on , stand where I am . ”\\n Harry stepped aside , but with Ron in front of the mirror , he couldn’t see his family anymore , just Ron in his paisley pajamas .\\n Ron , though , was staring transfixed at his image .\\n “ Look at me ! ”\\n he said .\\n “ Can you see all your family standing around you ? ”\\n “ No I’m alone but I’m different I look older and I’m Head Boy ! ”\\n “ What ? ”\\n “ I am I’m wearing the badge like Bill used to and I’m holding the House Cup and the Quidditch Cup I’m Quidditch captain , too ! ”\\n Ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at Harry .\\n “ Do you think this mirror shows the future ? ”\\n “ How can it ?\\n All my family are dead let me have another look ” “ You had it to yourself all last night , give me a bit more time . ”\\n “ You’re only holding the Quidditch Cup , what’s interesting about that ?\\n I want to see my parents . ”\\n “ Don’t push me ” A sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion .\\n They hadn’t realized how loudly they had been talking .\\n “ Quick ! ”\\n Ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs Norris came round the door .\\n Ron and Harry stood quite still , both thinking the same thing did the cloak work on cats ?\\n After what seemed an age , she turned and left .\\n “ This isn’t safe she might have gone for Filch , I bet she heard us .\\n Come on . ”\\n And Ron pulled Harry out of the room .\\n The snow still hadn’t melted the next morning .\\n “ Want to play chess , Harry ? ”\\n said Ron .\\n “ No . ”\\n “ Why don’t we go down and visit Hagrid ? ”\\n “ No you go ” “ I know what you’re thinking about , Harry , that mirror .\\n Don’t go back tonight . ”\\n “ Why not ? ”\\n “ I dunno , I’ve just got a bad feeling about it and anyway , you’ve had too many close shaves already .\\n Filch , Snape , and Mrs Norris are wandering around .\\n So what if they can’t see you ?\\n What if they walk into you ?\\n What if you knock something over ? ”\\n “ You sound like Hermione . ”\\n “ I’m serious , Harry , don’t go . ”\\n But Harry only had one thought in his head , which was to get back in front of the mirror , and Ron wasn’t going to stop him .\\n That third night he found his way more quickly than before .\\n He was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise , but he didn’t meet anyone .\\n And there were his mother and father smiling at him again , and one of his grandfathers nodding happily .\\n Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror .\\n There was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family .\\n Nothing at all .\\n Except “ So back again , Harry ? ”\\n Harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice .\\n He looked behind him .\\n Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore .\\n Harry must have walked straight past him , so desperate to get to the mirror he hadn’t noticed him .\\n “ I I didn’t see you , sir . ”\\n “ Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you , ” said Dumbledore , and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling .\\n “ So , ” said Dumbledore , slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry , “ you , like hundreds before you , have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised . ”\\n “ I didn’t know it was called that , sir . ”\\n “ But I expect you’ve realized by now what it does ? ”\\n “ It well it shows me my family ” “ And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy . ”\\n “ How did you know ? ”\\n “ I don’t need a cloak to become invisible , ” said Dumbledore gently .\\n “ Now , can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all ? ”\\n Harry shook his head .\\n “ Let me explain .\\n The happiest man on earth would be able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror , that is , he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is .\\n Does that help ? ”\\n Harry thought .\\n Then he said slowly , “ It shows us what we want whatever we want ” “ Yes and no , ” said Dumbledore quietly .\\n “ It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest , most desperate desire of our hearts .\\n You , who have never known your family , see them standing around you .\\n Ronald Weasley , who has always been overshadowed by his brothers , sees himself standing alone , the best of all of them .\\n However , this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth .\\n Men have wasted away before it , entranced by what they have seen , or been driven mad , not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible .\\n “ The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow , Harry , and I ask you not to go looking for it again .\\n If you ever do run across it , you will now be prepared .\\n It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live , remember that .\\n Now , why don’t you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed ? ”\\n Harry stood up .\\n “ Sir Professor Dumbledore ?\\n Can I ask you something ? ”\\n “ Obviously , you’ve just done so , ” Dumbledore smiled .\\n “ You may ask me one more thing , however . ”\\n “ What do you see when you look in the mirror ? ”\\n “ I ?\\n I see myself holding a pair of thick , woolen socks . ”\\n Harry stared .\\n “ One can never have enough socks , ” said Dumbledore .\\n “ Another Christmas has come and gone and I didn’t get a single pair .\\n People will insist on giving me books . ”\\n It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that Dumbledore might not have been quite truthful .\\n But then , he thought , as he shoved Scabbers off his pillow , it had been quite a personal question .',\n",
       "   'Chapter : NORBERT THE NORWEGIAN RIDGEBACK .\\n Quirrell , however , must have been braver than they’d thought .\\n In the weeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner , but it didn’t look as though he’d cracked yet .\\n Every time they passed the third floor corridor , Harry , Ron , and Hermione would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy was still growling inside .\\n Snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper , which surely meant that the Stone was still safe .\\n Whenever Harry passed Quirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile , and Ron had started telling people off for laughing at Quirrell’s stutter .\\n Hermione , however , had more on her mind than the Sorcerer’s Stone .\\n She had started drawing up study schedules and color coding all her notes .\\n Harry and Ron wouldn’t have minded , but she kept nagging them to do the same .\\n “ Hermione , the exams are ages away . ”\\n “ Ten weeks , ” Hermione snapped .\\n “ That’s not ages , that’s like a second to Nicolas Flamel . ”\\n “ But we’re not six hundred years old , ” Ron reminded her .\\n “ Anyway , what are you studying for , you already know it all . ”\\n “ What am I studying for ?\\n Are you crazy ?\\n You realize we need to pass these exams to get into the second year ?\\n They’re very important , I should have started studying a month ago , I don’t know what’s gotten into me . ”\\n Unfortunately , the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines as Hermione .\\n They piled so much homework on them that the Easter holidays weren’t nearly as much fun as the Christmas ones .\\n It was hard to relax with Hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragon’s blood or practicing wand movements .\\n Moaning and yawning , Harry and Ron spent most of their free time in the library with her , trying to get through all their extra work .\\n “ I’ll never remember this , ” Ron burst out one afternoon , throwing down his quill and looking longingly out of the library window .\\n It was the first really fine day they’d had in months .\\n The sky was a clear , forget me not blue , and there was a feeling in the air of summer coming .\\n Harry , who was looking up “ Dittany ” in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi , didn’t look up until he heard Ron say , “ Hagrid !\\n What are you doing in the library ? ”\\n Hagrid shuffled into view , hiding something behind his back .\\n He looked very out of place in his moleskin overcoat .\\n “ Jus ’ lookin ’ , ” he said , in a shifty voice that got their interest at once .\\n “ An ’ what’re you lot up ter ? ”\\n He looked suddenly suspicious .\\n “ Yer not still lookin ’ fer Nicolas Flamel , are yeh ? ”\\n “ Oh , we found out who he is ages ago , ” said Ron impressively .\\n “ And we know what that dog’s guarding , it’s a Sorcerer’s St ” “ Shhhh ” Hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening .\\n “ Don ’ go shoutin ’ about it , what’s the matter with yeh ? ”\\n “ There are a few things we wanted to ask you , as a matter of fact , ” said Harry , “ about what’s guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy ” “ SHHHH ! ”\\n said Hagrid again .\\n “ Listen come an ’ see me later , I’m not promisin ’ I’ll tell yeh anythin ’ , mind , but don ’ go rabbitin ’ about it in here , students aren ’ s’pposed ter know .\\n They’ll think I’ve told yeh ” “ See you later , then , ” said Harry .\\n Hagrid shuffled off .\\n “ What was he hiding behind his back ? ”\\n said Hermione thoughtfully .\\n “ Do you think it had anything to do with the Stone ? ”\\n “ I’m going to see what section he was in , ” said Ron , who’d had enough of working .\\n He came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms and slammed them down on the table .\\n “ Dragons ’ . ”\\n he whispered .\\n “ Hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons !\\n Look at these : Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland From Egg to Inferno , A Dragon Keeper’s Guide . ”\\n “ Hagrid ’ s always wanted a dragon , he told me so the first time I ever met him , ” said Harry .\\n “ But it’s against our laws , ” said Ron .\\n “ Dragon breeding was outlawed by the Warlocks ’ Convention of 1709 , everyone knows that .\\n It’s hard to stop Muggles from noticing us if we’re keeping dragons in the back garden anyway , you can’t tame dragons , it’s dangerous .\\n You should see the burns Charlie’s got off wild ones in Romania . ”\\n “ But there aren’t wild dragons in Britain ? ”\\n said Harry .\\n “ Of course there are , ” said Ron .\\n “ Common Welsh Green and Hebridean Blacks .\\n The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them up , I can tell you .\\n Our kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who’ve spotted them , to make them forget . ”\\n “ So what on earth’s Hagrid up to ? ”\\n said Hermione .\\n When they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper’s hut an hour later , they were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed .\\n Hagrid called “ Who is it ? ”\\n before he let them in , and then shut the door quickly behind them .\\n It was stifling hot inside .\\n Even though it was such a warm day , there was a blazing fire in the grate .\\n Hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat sandwiches , which they refused .\\n “ So yeh wanted to ask me somethin ’ ? ”\\n “ Yes , ” said Harry .\\n There was no point beating around the bush .\\n “ We were wondering if you could tell us what’s guarding the Sorcerer’s Stone apart from Fluffy . ”\\n Hagrid frowned at him .\\n “ O ’ course I can’t , ” he said .\\n “ Number one , I don ’ know meself .\\n Number two , yeh know too much already , so I wouldn ’ tell yeh if I could .\\n That Stone’s here fer a good reason .\\n It was almost stolen outta Gringotts I s’ppose yeh’ve worked that out an ’ all ?\\n Beats me how yeh even know abou ’ Fluffy . ”\\n “ Oh , come on , Hagrid , you might not want to tell us , but you do know , you know everything that goes on round here , ” said Hermione in a warm , flattering voice .\\n Hagrid ’ s beard twitched and they could tell he was smiling .\\n “ We only wondered who had done the guarding , really . ”\\n Hermione went on .\\n “ We wondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him , apart from you . ”\\n Hagrid ’ s chest swelled at these last words .\\n Harry and Ron beamed at Hermione .\\n “ Well , I don ’ s’pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that let’s see he borrowed Fluffy from me then some o ’ the teachers did enchantments Professor Sprout Professor Flitwick Professor McGonagall ” he ticked them off on his fingers , “ Professor Quirrell an ’ Dumbledore himself did somethin ’ , o ’ course .\\n Hang on , I’ve forgotten someone .\\n Oh yeah , Professor Snape . ”\\n “ Snape ? ”\\n “ Yeah yer not still on abou ’ that , are yeh ?\\n Look , Snape helped protect the Stone , he’s not about ter steal it . ”\\n Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he was .\\n If Snape had been in on protecting the Stone , it must have been easy to find out how the other teachers had guarded it .\\n He probably knew everything except , it seemed , Quirrell’s spell and how to get past Fluffy .\\n “ You’re the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy , aren’t you , Hagrid ? ”\\n said Harry anxiously .\\n “ And you wouldn’t tell anyone , would you ?\\n Not even one of the teachers ? ”\\n “ Not a soul knows except me an ’ Dumbledore , ” said Hagrid proudly .\\n “ Well , that’s something , ” Harry muttered to the others .\\n “ Hagrid , can we have a window open ?\\n I’m boiling . ”\\n “ Can’t , Harry , sorry , ” said Hagrid .\\n Harry noticed him glance at the fire .\\n Harry looked at it , too .\\n “ Hagrid what’s that ? ”\\n But he already knew what it was .\\n In the very heart of the fire , underneath the kettle , was a huge , black egg .\\n “ Ah , ” said Hagrid , fiddling nervously with his beard , “ That’s er ” “ Where did you get it , Hagrid ? ”\\n said Ron , crouching over the fire to get a closer look at the egg .\\n “ It must’ve cost you a fortune . ”\\n “ Won it , ” said Hagrid .\\n “ Las ’ night .\\n I was down in the village havin ’ a few drinks an ’ got into a game o ’ cards with a stranger .\\n Think he was quite glad ter get rid of it , ter be honest . ”\\n “ But what are you going to do with it when it’s hatched ? ”\\n said Hermione .\\n “ Well , I’ve bin doin ’ some readin ’ , ” said Hagrid , pulling a large book from under his pillow .\\n “ Got this outta the library Dragon Breeding for Pleasure and Profit it’s a bit outta date , o ’ course , but it’s all in here .\\n Keep the egg in the fire , ’ cause their mothers breathe on ’ em , see , an ’ when it hatches , feed it on a bucket o ’ brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour .\\n An ’ see here how ter recognize diff’rent eggs what I got there’s a Norwegian Ridge back .\\n They’re rare , them . ”\\n He looked very pleased with himself , but Hermione didn’t .\\n “ Hagrid , you live in a wooden house , ” she said .\\n But Hagrid wasn’t listening .\\n He was humming merrily as he stoked the fire .\\n So now they had something else to worry about : what might happen to Hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut .\\n “ Wonder what it’s like to have a peaceful life , ” Ron sighed , as evening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting .\\n Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and Ron , too .\\n It was driving them nuts .\\n Then , one breakfast time , Hedwig brought Harry another note from Hagrid .\\n He had written only two words : It’s hatching .\\n Ron wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut .\\n Hermione wouldn’t hear of it .\\n “ Hermione , how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatching ? ”\\n “ We’ve got lessons , we’ll get into trouble , and that’s nothing to what Hagrid ’ s going to be in when someone finds out what he’s doing ” “ Shut up ! ”\\n Harry whispered .\\n Malfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen .\\n How much had he heard ?\\n Harry didn’t like the look on Malfoy’s face at all .\\n Ron and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the end , Hermione agreed to run down to Hagrid’s with the other two during morning break .\\n When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson , the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest .\\n Hagrid greeted them , looking flushed and excited .\\n “ It’s nearly out . ”\\n He ushered them inside .\\n The egg was lying on the table .\\n There were deep cracks in it .\\n Something was moving inside a funny clicking noise was coming from it .\\n They all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated breath .\\n All at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open .\\n The baby dragon flopped onto the table .\\n It wasn’t exactly pretty Harry thought it looked like a crumpled , black umbrella .\\n Its spiny wings were huge compared to its skinny jet body , it had a long snout with wide nostrils , the stubs of horns and bulging , orange eyes .\\n It sneezed .\\n A couple of sparks flew out of its snout .\\n “ Isn’t he beautiful ? ”\\n Hagrid murmured .\\n He reached out a hand to stroke the dragon’s head .\\n It snapped at his fingers , showing pointed fangs .\\n “ Bless him , look , he knows his mommy ! ”\\n said Hagrid .\\n “ Hagrid , ” said Hermione , “ how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow , exactly ? ”\\n Hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from his face he leapt to his feet and ran to the window .\\n “ What’s the matter ? ”\\n “ Someone was lookin ’ through the gap in the curtains it’s a kid he’s runnin ’ back up ter the school . ”\\n Harry bolted to the door and looked out .\\n Even at a distance there was no mistaking him .\\n Malfoy had seen the dragon .\\n Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy’s face during the next week made Harry , Ron , and Hermione very nervous .\\n They spent most of their free time in Hagrid ’ s darkened hut , trying to reason with him .\\n “ Just let him go , ” Harry urged .\\n “ Set him free . ”\\n “ I can’t , ” said Hagrid .\\n “ He’s too little .\\n He’d die . ”\\n They looked at the dragon .\\n It had grown three times in length in just a week .\\n Smoke kept furling out of its nostrils .\\n Hagrid hadn’t been doing his gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy .\\n There were empty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over the floor .\\n “ I’ve decided to call him Norbert , ” said Hagrid , looking at the dragon with misty eyes .\\n “ He really knows me now , watch .\\n Norbert !\\n Norbert !\\n Where’s Mommy ? ”\\n “ He’s lost his marbles , ” Ron muttered in Harry’s ear .\\n “ Hagrid , ” said Harry loudly , “ give it two weeks and Norbert’s going to be as long as your house .\\n Malfoy could go to Dumbledore at any moment . ”\\n Hagrid bit his lip .\\n “ I I know I can’t keep him forever , but I can’t jus ’ dump him , can’t . ”\\n Harry suddenly turned to Ron .\\n “ Charlie , ” he said .\\n “ You’re losing it , too , ” said Ron .\\n “ I’m Ron , remember ? ”\\n “ No Charlie your brother , Charlie .\\n In Romania .\\n Studying dragons .\\n We could send Norbert to him .\\n Charlie can take care of him and then put him back in the wild ! ”\\n “ Brilliant ! ”\\n said Ron .\\n “ How about it , Hagrid ? ”\\n And in the end , Hagrid agreed that they could send an owl to Charlie to ask him .\\n The following week dragged by .\\n Wednesday night found Hermione and Harry sitting alone in the common room , long after everyone else had gone to bed .\\n The clock on the wall had just chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open .\\n Ron appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off Harry’s Invisibility Cloak .\\n He had been down at Hagrid’s hut , helping him feed Norbert , who was now eating dead rats by the crate .\\n “ It bit me ! ”\\n he said , showing them his hand , which was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief .\\n “ I’m not going to be able to hold a quill for a week .\\n I tell you , that dragon’s the most horrible animal I’ve ever met , but the way Hagrid goes on about it , you’d think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit .\\n When it bit me he told me off for frightening it .\\n And when I left , he was singing it a lullaby . ”\\n There was a tap on the dark window .\\n “ It’s Hedwig ! ”\\n said Harry , hurrying to let her in .\\n “ She’ll have Charlie’s answer ! ”\\n The three of them put their heads together to read the note .\\n Dear Ron , How are you ?\\n Thanks for the letter I’d be glad to take the Norwegian Ridgeback , but it won’t be easy getting him here .\\n I think the best thing will be to send him over with some friends of mine who are coming to visit me next week .\\n Trouble is , they mustn’t be seen carrying an illegal dragon .\\n Could you get the Ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on Saturday ?\\n They can meet you there and take him away while it’s still dark .\\n Send me an answer as soon as possible .\\n Love , Charlie They looked at one another .\\n “ We’ve got the Invisibility Cloak , ” said Harry .\\n “ It shouldn’t be too difficult I think the cloak’s big enough to cover two of us and Norbert . ”\\n It was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two agreed with him .\\n Anything to get rid of Norbert and Malfoy .\\n There was a hitch .\\n By the next morning , Ron’s bitten hand had swollen to twice its usual size .\\n He didn’t know whether it was safe to go to Madam Pomfrey would she recognize a dragon bite ?\\n By the afternoon , though , he had no choice .\\n The cut had turned a nasty shade of green .\\n It looked as if Norbert’s fangs were poisonous .\\n Harry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find Ron in a terrible state in bed .\\n “ It’s not just my hand , ” he whispered , “ although that feels like it’s about to fall off .\\n Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me .\\n He kept threatening to tell her what really bit me I’ve told her it was a dog , but I don’t think she believes me I shouldn’t have hit him at the Quidditch match , that’s why he’s doing this . ”\\n Harry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down .\\n “ It’ll all be over at midnight on Saturday , ” said Hermione , but this didn’t soothe Ron at all .\\n On the contrary , he sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat .\\n “ Midnight on Saturday ! ”\\n he said in a hoarse voice .\\n “ Oh no oh no I’ve just remembered Charlie’s letter was in that book Malfoy took , he’s going to know we’re getting rid of Norbert . ”\\n Harry and Hermione didn’t get a chance to answer .\\n Madam Pomfrey came over at that moment and made them leave , saying Ron needed sleep .\\n “ It’s too late to change the plan now , ” Harry told Hermione .\\n “ We haven’t got time to send Charlie another owl , and this could be our only chance to get rid of Norbert .\\n We’ll have to risk it .\\n And we have got the Invisibility Cloak , Malfoy doesn’t know about that . ”\\n They found Fang the boarhound sitting outside with a bandaged tail when they went to tell Hagrid , who opened a window to talk to them .\\n “ I won’t let you in , ” he puffed .\\n “ Norbert’s at a tricky stage nothin ’ I can’t handle . ”\\n When they told him about Charlie’s letter , his eyes filled with tears , although that might have been because Norbert had just bitten him on the leg .\\n “ Aargh !\\n It’s all right , he only got my boot jus ’ playin ’ he’s only a baby , after all . ”\\n The baby banged its tail on the wall , making the windows rattle .\\n Harry and Hermione walked back to the castle feeling Saturday couldn’t come quickly enough .\\n They would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time came for him to say good bye to Norbert if they hadn’t been so worried about what they had to do .\\n It was a very dark , cloudy night , and they were a bit late arriving at Hagrid ’ s hut because they’d had to wait for Peeves to get out of their way in the entrance hall , where he’d been playing tennis against the wall .\\n Hagrid had Norbert packed and ready in a large crate .\\n “ He’s got lots o ’ rats an ’ some brandy fer the journey , ” said Hagrid in a muffled voice .\\n “ An ’ I’ve packed his teddy bear in case he gets lonely . ”\\n From inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to Harry as though the teddy was having his head torn off .\\n “ Bye bye , Norbert ! ”\\n Hagrid sobbed , as Harry and Hermione covered the crate with the Invisibility Cloak and stepped underneath it themselves .\\n “ Mommy will never forget you ! ”\\n How they managed to get the crate back up to the castle , they never knew .\\n Midnight ticked nearer as they heaved Norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors .\\n Up another staircase , then another even one of Harry’s shortcuts didn’t make the work much easier .\\n “ Nearly there ! ”\\n Harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the tallest tower .\\n Then a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crate .\\n Forgetting that they were already invisible , they shrank into the shadows , staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet away .\\n A lamp flared .\\n Professor McGonagall , in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net , had Malfoy by the ear .\\n “ Detention ! ”\\n she shouted .\\n “ And twenty points from Slytherin !\\n Wandering around in the middle of the night , how dare you ” “ You don’t understand , Professor .\\n Harry Potter’s coming he’s got a dragon ! ”\\n “ What utter rubbish !\\n How dare you tell such lies !\\n Come on I shall see Professor Snape about you , Malfoy ! ”\\n The steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that .\\n Not until they’d stepped out into the cold night air did they throw off the cloak , glad to be able to breathe properly again .\\n Hermione did a sort of jig .\\n “ Malfoy’s got detention !\\n I could sing ! ”\\n “ Don’t , ” Harry advised her .\\n Chuckling about Malfoy , they waited , Norbert thrashing about in his crate .\\n About ten minutes later , four broomsticks came swooping down out of the darkness .\\n Charlie’s friends were a cheery lot .\\n They showed Harry and Hermione the harness they’d rigged up , so they could suspend Norbert between them .\\n They all helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry and Hermione shook hands with the others and thanked them very much .\\n At last , Norbert was going going gone .\\n They slipped back down the spiral staircase , their hearts as light as their hands , now that Norbert was off them .\\n No more dragon Malfoy in detention what could spoil their happiness ?\\n The answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs .\\n As they stepped into the corridor , Filch’s face loomed suddenly out of the darkness .\\n “ Well , well , well , ” he whispered , “ we are in trouble . ”\\n They’d left the Invisibility Cloak on top of the tower .',\n",
       "   'Chapter : THE POTIONS MASTER .\\n “ There , look . ”\\n “ Where ? ”\\n “ Next to the tall kid with the red hair . ”\\n “ Wearing the glasses ? ”\\n “ Did you see his face ? ”\\n “ Did you see his scar ? ”\\n Whispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next day .\\n People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him , or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again , staring .\\n Harry wished they wouldn’t , because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes .\\n There were a hundred and forty two staircases at Hogwarts : wide , sweeping ones narrow , rickety ones some that led somewhere different on a Friday some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump .\\n Then there were doors that wouldn’t open unless you asked politely , or tickled them in exactly the right place , and doors that weren’t really doors at all , but solid walls just pretending .\\n It was also very hard to remember where anything was , because it all seemed to move around a lot .\\n The people in the portraits kept going to visit each other , and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk .\\n The ghosts didn’t help , either .\\n It was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open .\\n Nearly Headless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right direction , but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class .\\n He would drop wastepaper baskets on your head , pull rugs from under your feet , pelt you with bits of chalk , or sneak up behind you , invisible , grab your nose , and screech , “ GOT YOUR CONK ! ”\\n Even worse than Peeves , if that was possible , was the caretaker , Argus Filch .\\n Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning .\\n Filch found them trying to force their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out of bounds corridor on the third floor .\\n He wouldn’t believe they were lost , was sure they were trying to break into it on purpose , and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by Professor Quirrell , who was passing .\\n Filch owned a cat called Mrs Norris , a scrawny , dust colored creature with bulging , lamplike eyes just like Filch’s .\\n She patrolled the corridors alone .\\n Break a rule in front of her , put just one toe out of line , and she’d whisk off for Filch , who’d appear , wheezing , two seconds later .\\n Filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone ( except perhaps the Weasley twins ) and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts .\\n The students all hated him , and it was the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs Norris a good kick .\\n And then , once you had managed to find them , there were the classes themselves .\\n There was a lot more to magic , as Harry quickly found out , than waving your wand and saying a few funny words .\\n They had to study the night skies through their telescopes every Wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets .\\n Three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology , with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout , where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi , and found out what they were used for .\\n Easily the most boring class was History of Magic , which was the only one taught by a ghost .\\n Professor Binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach , leaving his body behind him .\\n Binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates , and got Emeric the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up .\\n Professor Flitwick , the Charms teacher , was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk .\\n At the start of their first class he took the roll call , and when he reached Harry’s name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight .\\n Professor McGonagall was again different .\\n Harry had been quite right to think she wasn’t a teacher to cross .\\n Strict and clever , she gave them a talking to the moment they sat down in her first class .\\n “ Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts , ” she said .\\n “ Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back .\\n You have been warned . ”\\n Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again .\\n They were all very impressed and couldn’t wait to get started , but soon realized they weren’t going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time .\\n After taking a lot of complicated notes , they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle .\\n By the end of the lesson , only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile .\\n The class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense Against the Dark Arts , but Quirrell’s lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke .\\n His classroom smelled strongly of garlic , which everyone said was to ward off a vampire he’d met in Romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days .\\n His turban , he told them , had been given to him by an African prince as a thank you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie , but they weren’t sure they believed this story .\\n For one thing , when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the zombie , Quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather for another , they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban , and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well , so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went .\\n Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn’t miles behind everyone else .\\n Lots of people had come from Muggle families and , like him , hadn’t had any idea that they were witches and wizards .\\n There was so much to learn that even people like Ron didn’t have much of a head start .\\n Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron .\\n They finally managed to find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once .\\n “ What have we got today ? ”\\n Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his porridge .\\n “ Double Potions with the Slytherins , ” said Ron .\\n “ Snape’s Head of Slytherin House .\\n They say he always favors them we’ll be able to see if it’s true . ”\\n “ Wish McGonagall favored us , ” said Harry .\\n Professor McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House , but it hadn’t stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before .\\n Just then , the mail arrived .\\n Harry had gotten used to this by now , but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning , when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast , circling the tables until they saw their owners , and dropping letters and packages onto their laps .\\n Hedwig hadn’t brought Harry anything so far .\\n She sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls .\\n This morning , however , she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto Harry’s plate .\\n Harry tore it open at once .\\n It said , in a very untidy scrawl : Dear Harry , I know you get Friday afternoons off so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three ?\\n I want to hear all about your first week .\\n Send us an answer back with Hedwig .\\n Hagrid Harry borrowed Ron’s quill , scribbled Yes , please , see you later on the back of the note , and sent Hedwig off again .\\n It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to , because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far .\\n At the start of term banquet , Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape disliked him .\\n By the end of the first Potions lesson , he knew he’d been wrong .\\n Snape didn’t dislike Harry he hated him .\\n Potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons .\\n It was colder here than up in the main castle , and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls .\\n Snape , like Flitwick , started the class by taking the roll call , and like Flitwick , he paused at Harry’s name .\\n “ Ah , yes , ” he said softly , “ Harry Potter .\\n Our new celebrity . ”\\n Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their hands .\\n Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class .\\n His eyes were black like Hagrid ’ s , but they had none of Hagrid ’ s warmth .\\n They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels .\\n “ You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion making , ” he began .\\n He spoke in barely more than a whisper , but they caught every word like Professor McGonagall , Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort .\\n “ As there is little foolish wand waving here , many of you will hardly believe this is magic .\\n I don’t expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes , the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins , bewitching the mind , ensnaring the senses .\\n I can teach you how to bottle fame , brew glory , even stopper death if you aren’t as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach . ”\\n More silence followed this little speech .\\n Harry and Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows .\\n Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasn’t a dunderhead .\\n “ Potter ! ”\\n said Snape suddenly .\\n “ What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood ? ”\\n Powdered root of what to an infusion of what ?\\n Harry glanced at Ron , who looked as stumped as he was Hermione ’ s hand had shot into the air .\\n “ I don’t know , sir , ” said Harry .\\n Snape ’ s lips curled into a sneer .\\n “ Tut , tut fame clearly isn’t everything . ”\\n He ignored Hermione ’ s hand .\\n “ Let’s try again .\\n Potter , where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar ? ”\\n Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat , but Harry didn’t have the faintest idea what a bezoar was .\\n He tried not to look at Malfoy , Crabbe , and Goyle , who were shaking with laughter .\\n “ I don’t know , sir . ”\\n “ Thought you wouldn’t open a book before coming , eh , Potter ? ”\\n Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes .\\n He had looked through his books at the Dursleys ’ , but did Snape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi ?\\n Snape was still ignoring Hermione’s quivering hand .\\n “ What is the difference , Potter , between monkshood and wolfsbane ? ”\\n At this , Hermione stood up , her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling .\\n “ I don’t know , ” said Harry quietly .\\n “ I think Hermione does , though , why don’t you try her ? ”\\n A few people laughed Harry caught Seamus’s eye , and Seamus winked .\\n Snape , however , was not pleased .\\n “ Sit down , ” he snapped at Hermione .\\n “ For your information , Potter , asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death .\\n A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons .\\n As for monkshood and wolfsbane , they are the same plant , which also goes by the name of aconite .\\n Well ?\\n Why aren’t you all copying that down ? ”\\n There was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment .\\n Over the noise , Snape said , “ And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek , Potter . ”\\n Things didn’t improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued .\\n Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils .\\n He swept around in his long black cloak , watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs , criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy , whom he seemed to like .\\n He was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon .\\n Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamus’s cauldron into a twisted blob , and their potion was seeping across the stone floor , burning holes in people’s shoes .\\n Within seconds , the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville , who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed , moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs .\\n “ Idiot boy ! ”\\n snarled Snape , clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand .\\n “ I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire ? ”\\n Neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose .\\n “ Take him up to the hospital wing , ” Snape spat at Seamus .\\n Then he rounded on Harry and Ron , who had been working next to Neville .\\n “ You Potter why didn’t you tell him not to add the quills ?\\n Thought he’d make you look good if he got it wrong , did you ?\\n That’s another point you’ve lost for Gryffindor . ”\\n This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue , but Ron kicked him behind their cauldron .\\n “ Don’t push it , ” he muttered , “ I’ve heard Snape can turn very nasty . ”\\n As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later , Harry’s mind was racing and his spirits were low .\\n He’d lost two points for Gryffindor in his very first week why did Snape hate him so much ?\\n “ Cheer up , ” said Ron , “ Snape’s always taking points off Fred and George .\\n Can I come and meet Hagrid with you ? ”\\n At five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds .\\n Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest .\\n A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door .\\n When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks .\\n Then Hagrid ’ s voice rang out , saying , “ Back , Fang back . ”\\n Hagrid ’ s big , hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open .\\n “ Hang on , ” he said .\\n “ Back , Fang . ”\\n He let them in , struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound .\\n There was only one room inside .\\n Hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling , a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire , and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it .\\n “ Make yerselves at home , ” said Hagrid , letting go of Fang , who bounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears .\\n Like Hagrid , Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked .\\n “ This is Ron , ” Harry told Hagrid , who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate .\\n “ Another Weasley , eh ? ”\\n said Hagrid , glancing at Ron’s freckles .\\n “ I spent half me life chasin ’ yer twin brothers away from the forest . ”\\n The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth , but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all about their first lessons .\\n Fang rested his head on Harry’s knee and drooled all over his robes .\\n Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Filch “ that old git . ”\\n “ An ’ as fer that cat , Mrs Norris , I’d like ter introduce her to Fang sometime .\\n D’yeh know , every time I go up ter the school , she follows me everywhere ?\\n Can’t get rid of her Filch puts her up to it . ”\\n Harry told Hagrid about Snape’s lesson .\\n Hagrid , like Ron , told Harry not to worry about it , that Snape liked hardly any of the students .\\n “ But he seemed to really hate me . ”\\n “ Rubbish ! ”\\n said Hagrid .\\n “ Why should he ? ”\\n Yet Harry couldn’t help thinking that Hagrid didn’t quite meet his eyes when he said that .\\n “ How’s yer brother Charlie ? ”\\n Hagrid asked Ron .\\n “ I liked him a lot great with animals . ”\\n Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose .\\n While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie’s work with dragons , Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy .\\n It was a cutting from the Daily Prophet : GRINGOTTS BREAK IN LATEST Investigations continue into the break in at Gringotts on 3 1 July , widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown .\\n Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken .\\n The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day .\\n “ But we’re not telling you what was in there , so keep your noses out if you know what’s good for you , ” said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon .\\n Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob Gringotts , but Ron hadn’t mentioned the date .\\n “ Hagrid ! ”\\n said Harry , “ that Gringotts break in happened on my birthday !\\n It might’ve been happening while we were there ! ”\\n There was no doubt about it , Hagrid definitely didn’t meet Harry’s eyes this time .\\n He grunted and offered him another rock cake .\\n Harry read the story again .\\n The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day .\\n Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen , if you could call it emptying , taking out that grubby little package .\\n Had that been what the thieves were looking for ?\\n As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner , their pockets weighed down with rock cakes they’d been too polite to refuse , Harry thought that none of the lessons he’d had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with Hagrid .\\n Had Hagrid collected that package just in time ?\\n Where was it now ?\\n And did Hagrid know something about Snape that he didn’t want to tell Harry ?',\n",
       "   'Chapter : QUIDDITCH As they entered November , the weather turned very cold .\\n The mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel .\\n Every morning the ground was covered in frost .\\n Hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field , bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat , rabbit fur gloves , and enormous beaverskin boots .\\n The Quidditch season had begun .\\n On Saturday , Harry would be playing in his first match after weeks of training : Gryffindor versus Slytherin .\\n If Gryffindor won , they would move up into second place in the House Championship .\\n Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that , as their secret weapon , Harry should be kept , well , secret .\\n But the news that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow , and Harry didn’t know which was worse people telling him he’d be brilliant or people telling him they’d be running around underneath him holding a mattress .\\n It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermione as a friend .\\n He didn’t know how he’d have gotten through all his homework without her , what with all the last minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do .\\n She had also lent him Quidditch Through the Ages , which turned out to be a very interesting read .\\n Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup match in 1473 that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players , and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them that although people rarely died playing Quidditch , referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert .\\n Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll , and she was much nicer for it .\\n The day before Harry’s first Quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break , and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar .\\n They were standing with their backs to it , getting warm , when Snape crossed the yard .\\n Harry noticed at once that Snape was limping .\\n Harry , Ron , and Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view they were sure it wouldn’t be allowed .\\n Unfortunately , something about their guilty faces caught Snape’s eye .\\n He limped over .\\n He hadn’t seen the fire , but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off anyway .\\n “ What’s that you’ve got there , Potter ? ”\\n It was Quidditch Through the Ages .\\n Harry showed him .\\n “ Library books are not to be taken outside the school , ” said Snape .\\n “ Give it to me .\\n Five points from Gryffindor . ”\\n “ He’s just made that rule up , ” Harry muttered angrily as Snape limped away .\\n “ Wonder what’s wrong with his leg ? ”\\n “ Dunno , but I hope it’s really hurting him , ” said Ron bitterly .\\n The Gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening .\\n Harry , Ron , and Hermione sat together next to a window .\\n Hermione was checking Harry and Ron’s Charms homework for them .\\n She would never let them copy ( “ How will you learn ? ” ) ,\\n but by asking her to read it through , they got the right answers anyway .\\n Harry felt restless .\\n He wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back , to take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow .\\n Why should he be afraid of Snape ?\\n Getting up , he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask Snape if he could have it .\\n “ Better you than me , ” they said together , but Harry had an idea that Snape wouldn’t refuse if there were other teachers listening .\\n He made his way down to the staffroom and knocked .\\n There was no answer .\\n He knocked again .\\n Nothing .\\n Perhaps Snape had left the book in there ?\\n It was worth a try .\\n He pushed the door ajar and peered inside and a horrible scene met his eyes .\\n Snape and Filch were inside , alone .\\n Snape was holding his robes above his knees .\\n One of his legs was bloody and mangled .\\n Filch was handing Snape bandages .\\n “ Blasted thing , ” Snape was saying .\\n “ How are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once ? ”\\n Harry tried to shut the door quietly , but “ POTTER ! ”\\n Snape ’ s face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to hide his leg .\\n Harry gulped .\\n “ I just wondered if I could have my book back . ”\\n “ GET OUT !\\n OUT ! ”\\n Harry left , before Snape could take any more points from Gryffindor .\\n He sprinted back upstairs .\\n “ Did you get it ? ”\\n Ron asked as Harry joined them .\\n “ What’s the matter ? ”\\n In a low whisper , Harry told them what he’d seen .\\n “ You know what this means ? ”\\n he finished breathlessly .\\n “ He tried to get past that three headed dog at Halloween !\\n That’s where he was going when we saw him he’s after whatever it’s guarding !\\n And I’d bet my broomstick he let that troll in , to make a diversion ! ”\\n Hermione’s eyes were wide .\\n “ No he wouldn’t , ” she said .\\n “ I know he’s not very nice , but he wouldn’t try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe . ”\\n “ Honestly , Hermione , you think all teachers are saints or something , ” snapped Ron .\\n “ I’m with Harry .\\n I wouldn’t put anything past Snape .\\n But what’s he after ?\\n What’s that dog guarding ? ”\\n Harry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question .\\n Neville was snoring loudly , but Harry couldn’t sleep .\\n He tried to empty his mind he needed to sleep , he had to , he had his first Quidditch match in a few hours but the expression on Snape’s face when Harry had seen his leg wasn’t easy to forget .\\n The next morning dawned very bright and cold .\\n The Great Hall was full of the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheerful chatter of everyone looking forward to a good Quidditch match .\\n “ You’ve got to eat some breakfast . ”\\n “ I don’t want anything . ”\\n “ Just a bit of toast , ” wheedled Hermione .\\n “ I’m not hungry . ”\\n Harry felt terrible .\\n In an hour’s time he’d be walking onto the field .\\n “ Harry , you need your strength , ” said Seamus Finnigan .\\n “ Seekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team . ”\\n “ Thanks , Seamus , ” said Harry , watching Seamus pile ketchup on his sausages .\\n By eleven o’clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around the Quidditch pitch .\\n Many students had binoculars .\\n The seats might be raised high in the air , but it was still difficult to see what was going on sometimes .\\n Ron and Hermione joined Neville , Seamus , and Dean the West Ham fan up in the top row .\\n As a surprise for Harry , they had painted a large banner on one of the sheets Scabbers had ruined .\\n It said Potter for President , and Dean , who was good at drawing , had done a large Gryffindor lion underneath .\\n Then Hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different colors .\\n Meanwhile , in the locker room , Harry and the rest of the team were changing into their scarlet Quidditch robes ( Slytherin would be playing in green ) .\\n Wood cleared his throat for silence .\\n “ Okay , men , ” he said .\\n “ And women , ” said Chaser Angelina Johnson .\\n “ And women , ” Wood agreed .\\n “ This is it . ”\\n “ The big one , ” said Fred Weasley .\\n “ The one we’ve all been waiting for , ” said George .\\n “ We know Oliver’s speech by heart , ” Fred told Harry , “ we were on the team last year . ”\\n “ Shut up , you two , ” said Wood .\\n “ This is the best team Gryffindor’s had in years .\\n We’re going to win .\\n I know it . ”\\n He glared at them all as if to say , “ Or else . ”\\n “ Right .\\n It’s time .\\n Good luck , all of you . ”\\n Harry followed Fred and George out of the locker room and , hoping his knees weren’t going to give way , walked onto the field to loud cheers .\\n Madam Hooch was refereeing .\\n She stood in the middle of the field waiting for the two teams , her broom in her hand .\\n “ Now , I want a nice fair game , all of you , ” she said , once they were all gathered around her .\\n Harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the Slytherin Captain , Marcus Flint , a fifth year .\\n Harry thought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him .\\n Out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above , flashing Potter for President over the crowd .\\n His heart skipped .\\n He felt braver .\\n “ Mount your brooms , please . ”\\n Harry clambered onto his Nimbus Two Thousand .\\n Madam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle .\\n Fifteen brooms rose up , high , high into the air .\\n They were off .\\n “ And the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor what an excellent Chaser that girl is , and rather attractive , too ” “ JORDAN ! ”\\n “ Sorry , Professor . ”\\n The Weasley twins ’ friend , Lee Jordan , was doing the commentary for the match , closely watched by Professor McGonagall .\\n “ And she’s really belting along up there , a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet , a good find of Oliver Wood’s , last year only a reserve back to Johnson and no , the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle , Slytherin Captain Marcus Flint gains the Quaffle and off he goes Flint flying like an eagle up there he’s going to sc no , stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle that’s Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there , nice dive around Flint , off up the field and OUCH that must have hurt , hit in the back of the head by a Bludger Quaffle taken by the Slytherins that’s Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts , but he’s blocked by a second Bludger sent his way by Fred or George Weasley , can’t tell which nice play by the Gryffindor Beater , anyway , and Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle , a clear field ahead and off she goes she’s really flying dodges a speeding Bludger the goal posts are ahead come on , now , Angelina Keeper Bletchley dives misses GRYFFINDORS SCORE ! ”\\n Gryffindor cheers filled the cold air , with howls and moans from the Slytherins .\\n “ Budge up there , move along . ”\\n “ Hagrid ! ”\\n Ron and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid enough space to join them .\\n “ Bin watchin ’ from me hut , ” said Hagrid , patting a large pair of binoculars around his neck , “ But it isn’t the same as bein ’ in the crowd .\\n No sign of the Snitch yet , eh ? ”\\n “ Nope , ” said Ron .\\n “ Harry hasn’t had much to do yet . ”\\n “ Kept outta trouble , though , that’s somethin ’ , ” said Hagrid , raising his binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was Harry .\\n Way up above them , Harry was gliding over the game , squinting about for some sign of the Snitch .\\n This was part of his and Wood’s game plan .\\n “ Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch , ” Wood had said .\\n “ We don’t want you attacked before you have to be . ”\\n When Angelina had scored , Harry had done a couple of loop the loops to let off his feelings .\\n Now he was back to staring around for the Snitch .\\n Once he caught sight of a flash of gold , but it was just a reflection from one of the Weasleys ’ wristwatches , and once a Bludger decided to come pelting his way , more like a cannonball than anything , but Harry dodged it and Fred Weasley came chasing after it .\\n “ All right there , Harry ? ”\\n he had time to yell , as he beat the Bludger furiously toward Marcus Flint .\\n “ Slytherin in possession , ” Lee Jordan was saying , “ Chaser Pucey ducks two Bludgers , two Weasleys , and Chaser Bell , and speeds toward the wait a moment was that the Snitch ? ”\\n A murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey dropped the Quaffle , too busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left ear .\\n Harry saw it .\\n In a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the streak of gold .\\n Slytherin Seeker Terence Higgs had seen it , too .\\n Neck and neck they hurtled toward the Snitch all the Chasers seemed to have forgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to watch .\\n Harry was faster than Higgs he could see the little round ball , wings fluttering , darting up ahead he put on an extra spurt of speed WHAM !\\n A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors below Marcus Flint had blocked Harry on purpose , and Harry’s broom spun off course , Harry holding on for dear life .\\n “ Foul ! ”\\n screamed the Gryffindors .\\n Madam Hooch spoke angrily to Flint and then ordered a free shot at the goal posts for Gryffindor .\\n But in all the confusion , of course , the Golden Snitch had disappeared from sight again .\\n Down in the stands , Dean Thomas was yelling , “ Send him off , ref !\\n Red card ! ”\\n “ What are you talking about , Dean ? ”\\n said Ron .\\n “ Red card ! ”\\n said Dean furiously .\\n “ In soccer you get shown the red card and you’re out of the game ! ”\\n “ But this isn’t soccer , Dean , ” Ron reminded him .\\n Hagrid , however , was on Dean’s side .\\n “ They oughta change the rules .\\n Flint coulda knocked Harry outta the air . ”\\n Lee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides .\\n “ So after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating ” “ Jordan ! ”\\n growled Professor McGonagall .\\n “ I mean , after that open and revolting foul ” “ Jordan , I’m warning you ” “ All right , all right .\\n Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker , which could happen to anyone , I’m sure , so a penalty to Gryffindor , taken by Spinnet , who puts it away , no trouble , and we continue play , Gryffindor still in possession . ”\\n It was as Harry dodged another Bludger , which went spinning dangerously past his head , that it happened .\\n His broom gave a sudden , frightening lurch .\\n For a split second , he thought he was going to fall .\\n He gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and knees .\\n He’d never felt anything like that .\\n It happened again .\\n It was as though the broom was trying to buck him off .\\n But Nimbus Two Thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off .\\n Harry tried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal posts he had half a mind to ask Wood to call time out and then he realized that his broom was completely out of his control .\\n He couldn’t turn it .\\n He couldn’t direct it at all .\\n It was zigzagging through the air , and every now and then making violent swishing movements that almost unseated him .\\n Lee was still commentating .\\n “ Slytherin in possession Flint with the Quaffle passes Spinnet passes Bell hit hard in the face by a Bludger , hope it broke his nose only joking , Professor Slytherins score oh no ” The Slytherins were cheering .\\n No one seemed to have noticed that Harry’s broom was behaving strangely It was carrying him slowly higher , away from the game , jerking and twitching as it went .\\n “ Dunno what Harry thinks he’s doing , ” Hagrid mumbled .\\n He stared through his binoculars .\\n “ If I didn ’ know better , I’d say he’d lost control of his broom but he can’t have . ”\\n Suddenly , people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands .\\n His broom had started to roll over and over , with him only just managing to hold on .\\n Then the whole crowd gasped .\\n Harry’s broom had given a wild jerk and Harry swung off it .\\n He was now dangling from it , holding on with only one hand .\\n “ Did something happen to it when Flint blocked him ? ”\\n Seamus whispered .\\n “ Can’t have , ” Hagrid said , his voice shaking .\\n “ Can’t nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful Dark magic no kid could do that to a Nimbus Two Thousand . ”\\n At these words , Hermione seized Hagrid ’ s binoculars , but instead of looking up at Harry , she started looking frantically at the crowd .\\n “ What are you doing ? ”\\n moaned Ron , gray faced .\\n “ I knew it , ” Hermione gasped , “ Snape look . ”\\n Ron grabbed the binoculars .\\n Snape was in the middle of the stands opposite them .\\n He had his eyes fixed on Harry and was muttering nonstop under his breath .\\n “ He’s doing something jinxing the broom , ” said Hermione .\\n “ What should we do ? ”\\n “ Leave it to me . ”\\n Before Ron could say another word , Hermione had disappeared .\\n Ron turned the binoculars back on Harry .\\n His broom was vibrating so hard , it was almost impossible for him to hang on much longer .\\n The whole crowd was on its feet , watching , terrified , as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull Harry safely onto one of their brooms , but it was no good every time they got near him , the broom would jump higher still .\\n They dropped lower and circled beneath him , obviously hoping to catch him if he fell .\\n Marcus Flint seized the Quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing .\\n “ Come on , Hermione , ” Ron muttered desperately .\\n Hermione had fought her way across to the stand where Snape stood , and was now racing along the row behind him she didn’t even stop to say sorry as she knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in front .\\n Reaching Snape , she crouched down , pulled out her wand , and whispered a few , well chosen words .\\n Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of Snape ’ s robes .\\n It took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize that he was on fire .\\n A sudden yelp told her she had done her job .\\n Scooping the fire off him into a little jar in her pocket , she scrambled back along the row Snape would never know what had happened .\\n It was enough .\\n Up in the air , Harry was suddenly able to clamber back on to his broom .\\n “ Neville , you can look ! ”\\n Ron said .\\n Neville had been sobbing into Hagrid’s jacket for the last five minutes .\\n Harry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick he hit the field on all fours coughed and something gold fell into his hand .\\n “ I’ve got the Snitch ! ”\\n he shouted , waving it above his head , and the game ended in complete confusion .\\n “ He didn’t catch it , he nearly swallowed it , ” Flint was still howling twenty minutes later , but it made no difference Harry hadn’t broken any rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results Gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty .\\n Harry heard none of this , though .\\n He was being made a cup of strong tea back in Hagrid’s hut , with Ron and Hermione .\\n “ It was Snape , ” Ron was explaining , “ Hermione and I saw him .\\n He was cursing your broomstick , muttering , he wouldn’t take his eyes off you . ”\\n “ Rubbish , ” said Hagrid , who hadn’t heard a word of what had gone on next to him in the stands .\\n “ Why would Snape do somethin ’ like that ? ”\\n Harry , Ron , and Hermione looked at one another , wondering what to tell him .\\n Harry decided on the truth .\\n “ I found out something about him , ” he told Hagrid .\\n “ He tried to get past that three headed dog on Halloween .\\n It bit him .\\n We think he was trying to steal whatever it’s guarding . ”\\n Hagrid dropped the teapot .\\n “ How do you know about Fluffy ? ”\\n he said .\\n “ Fluffy ? ”\\n “ Yeah he’s mine bought him off a Greek chappie I met in the pub las ’ year I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the ” “ Yes ? ”\\n said Harry eagerly .\\n “ Now , don’t ask me anymore , ” said Hagrid gruffly .\\n “ That’s top secret , that is . ”\\n “ But Snape’s trying to steal it . ”\\n “ Rubbish , ” said Hagrid again .\\n “ Snape’s a Hogwarts teacher , he’d do nothin ’ of the sort . ”\\n “ So why did he just try and kill Harry ? ”\\n cried Hermione .\\n The afternoon’s events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about Snape .\\n “ I know a jinx when I see one , Hagrid , I’ve read all about them !\\n You’ve got to keep eye contact , and Snape wasn’t blinking at all , I saw him ! ”\\n “ I’m tellin ’ yeh , yer wrong ! ”\\n said Hagrid hotly .\\n “ I don ’ know why Harry’s broom acted like that , but Snape wouldn ’ try an ’ kill a student !\\n Now , listen to me , all three of yeh yer meddlin ’ in things that don ’ concern yeh .\\n It’s dangerous .\\n You forget that dog , an ’ you forget what it’s guardin ’ , that’s between Professor Dumbledore an ’ Nicolas Flamel ” “ Aha ! ”\\n said Harry , “ so there’s someone called Nicolas Flamel involved , is there ? ”\\n Hagrid looked furious with himself .',\n",
       "   'Chapter : THE SORTING HAT .\\n The door swung open at once .\\n A tall , black haired witch in emerald green robes stood there .\\n She had a very stern face and Harry’s first thought was that this was not someone to cross .\\n “ The firs ’ years , Professor McGonagall , ” said Hagrid .\\n “ Thank you , Hagrid .\\n I will take them from here . ”\\n She pulled the door wide .\\n The entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys ’ house in it .\\n The stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts , the ceiling was too high to make out , and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors .\\n They followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor .\\n Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right the rest of the school must already be here but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small , empty chamber off the hall .\\n They crowded in , standing rather closer together than they would usually have done , peering about nervously .\\n “ Welcome to Hogwarts , ” said Professor McGonagall .\\n “ The start of term banquet will begin shortly , but before you take your seats in the Great Hall , you will be sorted into your Houses .\\n The Sorting is a very important ceremony because , while you are here , your House will be something like your family within Hogwarts .\\n You will have classes with the rest of your House , sleep in your House dormitory , and spend free time in your House common room .\\n “ The four Houses are called Gryffindor , Hufflepuff , Ravenclaw , and Slytherin .\\n Each House has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards .\\n While you are at Hogwarts , your triumphs will earn your House points , while any rule breaking will lose House points .\\n At the end of the year , the House with the most points is awarded the House cup , a great honor .\\n I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever House becomes yours .\\n “ The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school .\\n I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting . ”\\n Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville’s cloak , which was fastened under his left ear , and on Ron’s smudged nose .\\n Harry nervously tried to flatten his hair .\\n “ I shall return when we are ready for you , ” said Professor McGonagall .\\n “ Please wait quietly . ”\\n She left the chamber .\\n Harry swallowed .\\n “ How exactly do they sort us into Houses ? ”\\n he asked Ron .\\n “ Some sort of test , I think .\\n Fred said it hurts a lot , but I think he was joking . ”\\n Harry’s heart gave a horrible jolt .\\n A test ?\\n In front of the whole school ?\\n But he didn’t know any magic yet what on earth would he have to do ?\\n He hadn’t expected something like this the moment they arrived .\\n He looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified , too .\\n No one was talking much except Hermione Granger , who was whispering very fast about all the spells she’d learned and wondering which one she’d need .\\n Harry tried hard not to listen to her .\\n He’d never been more nervous , never , not even when he’d had to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that he’d somehow turned his teachers wig blue .\\n He kept his eyes fixed on the door .\\n Any second now , Professor McGonagall would come back and lead him to his doom .\\n Then something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air several people behind him screamed .\\n “ What the ? ”\\n He gasped .\\n So did the people around him .\\n About twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall .\\n Pearly white and slightly transparent , they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years .\\n They seemed to be arguing .\\n What looked like a fat little monk was saying : “ Forgive and forget , I say , we ought to give him a second chance ” “ My dear Friar , haven’t we given Peeves all the chances he deserves ?\\n He gives us all a bad name and you know , he’s not really even a ghost I say , what are you all doing here ? ”\\n A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years .\\n Nobody answered .\\n “ New students ! ”\\n said the Fat Friar , smiling around at them .\\n “ About to be Sorted , I suppose ? ”\\n A few people nodded mutely .\\n “ Hope to see you in Hufflepuff ! ”\\n said the Friar .\\n “ My old House , you know . ”\\n “ Move along now , ” said a sharp voice .\\n “ The Sorting Ceremony’s about to start . ”\\n Professor McGonagall had returned .\\n One by one , the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall .\\n “ Now , form a line , ” Professor McGonagall told the first years , “ and follow me . ”\\n Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead , Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair , with Ron behind him , and they walked out of the chamber , back across the hall , and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall .\\n Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place .\\n It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables , where the rest of the students were sitting .\\n These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets .\\n At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting .\\n Professor McGonagall led the first years up here , so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students , with the teachers behind them .\\n The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight .\\n Dotted here and there among the students , the ghosts shone misty silver .\\n Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes , Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars .\\n He heard Hermione whisper , “ It’s bewitched to look like the sky outside .\\n I read about it in Hogwarts , A History . ”\\n It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all , and that the Great Hall didn’t simply open on to the heavens .\\n Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed a four legged stool in front of the first years .\\n On top of the stool she put a pointed wizard’s hat .\\n This hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty .\\n Aunt Petunia wouldn’t have let it in the house .\\n Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it , Harry thought wildly , that seemed the sort of thing noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat , he stared at it , too .\\n For a few seconds , there was complete silence .\\n Then the hat twitched .\\n A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth and the hat began to sing : “ Oh , you may not think I’m pretty , But don’t judge on what you see , I’ll eat myself if you can find A smarter hat than me .\\n You can keep your bowlers black , Your top hats sleek and tall , For I’m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat And I can cap them all .\\n There’s nothing hidden in your head The Sorting Hat can’t see , So try me on and I will tell you Where you ought to be .\\n You might belong in Gryffindor , Where dwell the brave at heart , Their daring , nerve , and chivalry Set Gryffindors apart You might belong in Hufflepuff , Where they are just and loyal , Those patient Hufflepuffs are true And unafraid of toil Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw , If you’ve a ready mind , Where those of wit and learning , Will always find their kind Or perhaps in Slytherin You’ll make your real friends , Those cunning folk use any means To achieve their ends .\\n So put me on !\\n Don’t be afraid l And don’t get in a flap You’re in safe hands ( though I have none ) For I’m a Thinking Cap ” The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song .\\n It bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again .\\n “ So we’ve just got to try on the hat ! ”\\n Ron whispered to Harry .\\n “ I’ll kill Fred , he was going on about wrestling a troll . ”\\n Harry smiled weakly .\\n Yes , trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell , but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching .\\n The hat seemed to be asking rather a lot Harry didn’t feel brave or quick witted or any of it at the moment .\\n If only the hat had mentioned a House for people who felt a bit queasy , that would have been the one for him .\\n Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment .\\n “ When I call your name , you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted , ” she said .\\n “ Abbott , Hannah ! ”\\n A pink faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line , put on the hat , which fell right down over her eyes , and sat down .\\n A moment’s pause “ HUFFLEPUFF ! ”\\n shouted the hat .\\n The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table .\\n Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her .\\n “ Bones , Susan ! ”\\n “ HUFFLEPUFF ! ”\\n shouted the hat again , and Susan scuttled off to sit next to Hannah .\\n “ Boot , Terry ! ”\\n “ RAVENCLAW ! ”\\n The table second from the left clapped this time several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them .\\n “ Brocklehurst , Mandy ” went to Ravenclaw too , but “ Brown , Lavender ” became the first new Gryffindor , and the table on the far left exploded with cheers Harry could see Ron’s twin brothers catcalling .\\n “ Bulstrode , Millicent ” then became a Slytherin .\\n Perhaps it was Harry’s imagination , after all he’d heard about Slytherin , but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot .\\n He was starting to feel definitely sick now .\\n He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school .\\n He had always been last to be chosen , not because he was no good , but because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him .\\n “ Finch Fletchley , Justin ! ”\\n “ HUFFLEPUFF ! ”\\n Sometimes , Harry noticed , the hat shouted out the House at once , but at others it took a little while to decide .\\n “ Finnigan , Seamus , ” the sandy haired boy next to Harry in the line , sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor .\\n “ Granger , Hermione ! ”\\n Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head .\\n “ GRYFFINDOR ! ”\\n shouted the hat .\\n Ron groaned .\\n A horrible thought struck Harry , as horrible thoughts always do when you’re very nervous .\\n What if he wasn’t chosen at all ?\\n What if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages , until Professor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and he’d better get back on the train ?\\n When Neville Longbottom , the boy who kept losing his toad , was called , he fell over on his way to the stool .\\n The hat took a long time to decide with Neville .\\n When it finally shouted , “ GRYFFINDOR , ” Neville ran off still wearing it , and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to “ MacDougal , Morag . ”\\n Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once : the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed , “ SLYTHERIN ! ”\\n Malfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle , looking pleased with himself .\\n There weren’t many people left now .\\n “ Moon ” , “ Nott ” , “ Parkinson ” , then a pair of twin girls , “ Path ” and “ Path ” , then “ Perks , Sally Anne ” , and then , at last “ Potter , Harry ! ”\\n As Harry stepped forward , whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall .\\n “ Potter , did she say ? ”\\n “ The Harry Potter ? ”\\n The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him .\\n Next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat .\\n He waited .\\n “ Hmm , ” said a small voice in his ear .\\n “ Difficult .\\n Very difficult .\\n Plenty of courage , I see .\\n Not a bad mind either .\\n There’s talent , oh my goodness , yes and a nice thirst to prove yourself , now that’s interesting .\\n So where shall I put you ? ”\\n Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought , Not Slytherin , not Slytherin .\\n “ Not Slytherin , eh ? ”\\n said the small voice .\\n “ Are you sure ?\\n You could be great , you know , it’s all here in your head , and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness , no doubt about that no ?\\n Well , if you’re sure better be GRYFFINDOR ! ”\\n Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall .\\n He took off the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table .\\n He was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin , he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet .\\n Percy the Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously , while the Weasley twins yelled , “ We got Potter !\\n We got Potter ! ”\\n Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he’d seen earlier .\\n The ghost patted his arm , giving Harry the sudden , horrible feeling he’d just plunged it into a bucket of ice cold water .\\n He could see the High Table properly now .\\n At the end nearest him sat Hagrid , who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up .\\n Harry grinned back .\\n And there , in the center of the High Table , in a large gold chair , sat Albus Dumbledore .\\n Harry recognized him at once from the card he’d gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train .\\n Dumbledore’s silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts .\\n Harry spotted Professor Quirrell , too , the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron .\\n He was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban .\\n And now there were only four people left to be sorted .\\n “ Thomas , Dean , ” a Black boy even taller than Ron , joined Harry at the Gryffindor table .\\n “ Turpin , Lisa , ” became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron’s turn .\\n He was pale green by now .\\n Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted , “ GRYFFINDOR ! ”\\n Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next to him .\\n “ Well done , Ron , excellent , ” said Percy Weasley pompously across Harry as “ Zabini , Blaise , ” was made a Slytherin .\\n Professor McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away .\\n Harry looked down at his empty gold plate .\\n He had only just realized how hungry he was .\\n The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago .\\n Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet .\\n He was beaming at the students , his arms opened wide , as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there .\\n “ Welcome ! ”\\n he said .\\n “ Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts !\\n Before we begin our banquet , I would like to say a few words .\\n And here they are : Nitwit !\\n Blubber !\\n Oddment !\\n Tweak !\\n “ Thank you ! ”\\n He sat back down .\\n Everybody clapped and cheered .\\n Harry didn’t know whether to laugh or not .\\n “ Is he a bit mad ? ”\\n he asked Percy uncertainly .\\n “ Mad ? ”\\n said Percy airily .\\n “ He’s a genius !\\n Best wizard in the world !\\n But he is a bit mad , yes .\\n Potatoes , Harry ? ”\\n Harry’s mouth fell open .\\n The dishes in front of him were now piled with food .\\n He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table : roast beef , roast chicken , pork chops and lamb chops , sausages , bacon and steak , boiled potatoes , roast potatoes , fries , Yorkshire pudding , peas , carrots , gravy , ketchup , and , for some strange reason , peppermint humbugs .\\n The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry , but he’d never been allowed to eat as much as he liked .\\n Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted , even if it made him sick .\\n Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat .\\n It was all delicious .\\n “ That does look good , ” said the ghost in the ruff sadly , watching Harry cut up his steak .\\n “ Can’t you ? ”\\n “ I haven’t eaten for nearly five hundred years , ” said the ghost .\\n “ I don’t need to , of course , but one does miss it .\\n I don’t think I’ve introduced myself ?\\n Sir Nicholas de Mimsy Porpington at your service .\\n Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower . ”\\n “ I know who you are ! ”\\n said Ron suddenly .\\n “ My brothers told me about you you’re Nearly Headless Nick ! ”\\n “ I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy ” the ghost began stiffly , but sandy haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted .\\n “ Nearly Headless ?\\n How can you be nearly headless ? ”\\n Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed , as if their little chat wasn’t going at all the way he wanted .\\n “ Like this , ” he said irritably .\\n He seized his left ear and pulled .\\n His whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge .\\n Someone had obviously tried to behead him , but not done it properly .\\n Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces , Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck , coughed , and said , “ So new Gryffindors !\\n I hope you’re going to help us win the House Championship this year ?\\n Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning .\\n Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row !\\n The Bloody Baron’s becoming almost unbearable he’s the Slytherin ghost . ”\\n Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there , with blank staring eyes , a gaunt face , and robes stained with silver blood .\\n He was right next to Malfoy who , Harry was pleased to see , didn’t look too pleased with the seating arrangements .\\n “ How did he get covered in blood ? ”\\n asked Seamus with great interest .\\n “ I’ve never asked , ” said Nearly Headless Nick delicately .\\n When everyone had eaten as much as they could , the remains of the food faded from the plates , leaving them sparkling clean as before .\\n A moment later the desserts appeared .\\n Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of , apple pies , treacle tarts , chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts , trifle , strawberries , Jell 0 , rice pudding As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart , the talk turned to their families .\\n “ I’m half and half , ” said Seamus .\\n “ Me dad’s a Muggle .\\n Mom didn’t tell him she was a witch ’ til after they were married .\\n Bit of a nasty shock for him . ”\\n The others laughed .\\n “ What about you , Neville ? ”\\n said Ron .\\n “ Well , my gran brought me up and she’s a witch , ” said Neville , “ but the family thought I was all Muggle for ages .\\n My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once , I nearly drowned but nothing happened until I was eight .\\n Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner , and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go .\\n But I bounced all the way down the garden and into the road .\\n They were all really pleased , Gran was crying , she was so happy .\\n And you should have seen their faces when I got in here they thought I might not be magic enough to come , you see .\\n Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad . ”\\n On Harry’s other side , Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons ( “ I do hope they start right away , there’s so much to learn , I’m particularly interested in Transfiguration , you know , turning something into something else , of course , it’s supposed to be very difficult “ You’ll be starting small , just matches into needles and that sort of thing ” ) .\\n Harry , who was starting to feel warm and sleepy , looked up at the High Table again .\\n Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet .\\n Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore .\\n Professor Quirrell , in his absurd turban , was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair , a hooked nose , and sallow skin .\\n It happened very suddenly .\\n The hook nosed teacher looked past Quirrell’s turban straight into Harry’s eyes and a sharp , hot pain shot across the scar on Harry’s forehead .\\n “ Ouch ! ”\\n Harry clapped a hand to his head .\\n “ What is it ? ”\\n asked Percy .\\n “ N nothing . ”\\n The pain had gone as quickly as it had come .\\n Harder to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher’s look a feeling that he didn’t like Harry at all .\\n “ Who’s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell ? ”\\n he asked Percy .\\n “ Oh , you know Quirrell already , do you ?\\n No wonder he’s looking so nervous , that’s Professor Snape .\\n He teaches Potions , but he doesn’t want to everyone knows he’s after Quirrell’s job .\\n Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts , Snape . ”\\n Harry watched Snape for a while , but Snape didn’t look at him again .\\n At last , the desserts too disappeared , and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again .\\n The hall fell silent .\\n “ Ahem just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered .\\n I have a few start of term notices to give you .\\n “ First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils .\\n And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well . ”\\n Dumbledore ’ s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins .\\n “ I have also been asked by Mr Filch , the caretaker , to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors .\\n “ Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term .\\n Anyone interested in playing for their House teams should contact Madam Hooch .\\n “ And finally , I must tell you that this year , the third floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death . ”\\n Harry laughed , but he was one of the few who did .\\n “ He’s not serious ? ”\\n he muttered to Percy .\\n “ Must be , ” said Percy , frowning at Dumbledore .\\n “ It’s odd , because he usually gives us a reason why we’re not allowed to go somewhere the forest’s full of dangerous beasts , everyone knows that .\\n I do think he might have told us prefects , at least . ”\\n “ And now , before we go to bed , let us sing the school song ! ”\\n cried Dumbledore .\\n Harry noticed that the other teachers ’ smiles had become rather fixed .\\n Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick , as if he was trying to get a fly off the end , and a long golden ribbon flew out of it , which rose high above the tables and twisted itself , snakelike , into words .\\n “ Everyone pick their favorite tune , ” said Dumbledore , “ and off we go ! ”\\n And the school bellowed : “ Hogwarts , Hogwarts , Hoggy Warty Hogwarts , Teach us something please , Whether we be old and bald Or young with scabby knees , Our heads could do with filling With some interesting stuff , For now they’re bare and full of air , Dead flies and bits of fluff , So teach us things worth knowing , Bring back what we’ve forgot , Just do your best , we’ll do the rest , And learn until our brains all rot . ”\\n Everybody finished the song at different times .\\n At last , only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march .\\n Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished , he was one of those who clapped loudest .\\n “ Ah , music , ” he said , wiping his eyes .\\n “ A magic beyond all we do here !\\n And now , bedtime .\\n Off you trot ! ”\\n The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds , out of the Great Hall , and up the marble staircase .\\n Harry’s legs were like lead again , but only because he was so tired and full of food .\\n He was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed , or that twice Percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries .\\n They climbed more staircases , yawning and dragging their feet , and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt .\\n A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them , and as Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him .\\n “ Peeves , ” Percy whispered to the first years .\\n “ A poltergeist . ”\\n He raised his voice , “ Peeves show yourself . ”\\n A loud , rude sound , like the air being let out of a balloon , answered .\\n “ Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron ? ”\\n There was a pop , and a little man with wicked , dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared , floating cross legged in the air , clutching the walking sticks .\\n “ Oooooooh ! ”\\n he said , with an evil cackle .\\n “ Ickle Firsties !\\n What fun ! ”\\n He swooped suddenly at them .\\n They all ducked .\\n “ Go away , Peeves , or the Baron’ll hear about this , I mean it ! ”\\n barked Percy .\\n Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished , dropping the walking sticks on Neville’s head .\\n They heard him zooming away , rattling coats of armor as he passed .\\n “ You want to watch out for Peeves , ” said Percy , as they set off again .\\n “ The Bloody Baron’s the only one who can control him , he won’t even listen to us prefects .\\n Here we are . ”\\n At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress .\\n “ Password ? ”\\n she said .\\n “ Caput Draconis , ” said Percy , and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall .\\n They all scrambled through it Neville needed a leg up and found themselves in the Gryffindor common room , a cozy , round room full of squashy armchairs .\\n Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another .\\n At the top of a spiral staircase they were obviously in one of the towers they found their beds at last : five four posters hung with deep red , velvet curtains .\\n Their trunks had already been brought up .\\n Too tired to talk much , they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed .\\n “ Great food , isn’t it ? ”\\n Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings .\\n “ Get off Scabbers !\\n He’s chewing my sheets . ”\\n Harry was going to ask Ron if he’d had any of the treacle tart , but he fell asleep almost at once .\\n Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much , because he had a very strange dream .\\n He was wearing Professor Quirrell’s turban , which kept talking to him , telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once , because it was his destiny .\\n Harry told the turban he didn’t want to be in Slytherin it got heavier and heavier he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully and there was Malfoy , laughing at him as he struggled with it then Malfoy turned into the hook nosed teacher , Snape , whose laugh became high and cold there was a burst of green light and Harry woke , sweating and shaking .\\n He rolled over and fell asleep again , and when he woke next day , he didn’t remember the dream at all .']]}"
